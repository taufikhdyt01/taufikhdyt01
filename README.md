### Hi there!ðŸ‘‹

My name is Taufik Hidayat, and I am currently an Undergraduate Information Technology Education Student at Brawijaya University. I have taken on a role as a practicum assistant, where I am responsible for teaching practicum sessions at the Faculty of Computer Science at Brawijaya University. In addition, I am a highly active and engaged individual, regularly participating in various organizational and committee activities on campus.

I have a passion for technology and am always eager to learn more about the many different aspects of this fascinating field. If you are interested in sympathizing with me, please follow my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tfkhdyt/) account.
